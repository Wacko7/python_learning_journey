# Python Basics# 🧩 Module 00 — Python Basics

## 🎯 Objective
Learn the core Python skills needed for blockchain and data analysis:
- Variables, lists, and dictionaries  
- Loops and functions  
- Reading/writing JSON files (used in APIs and blockchain data)  

These are the foundations of every crypto or data job.  
All later modules (API calls, data analysis, ML, blockchain) depend on this.

## 📚 Lessons
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `lesson1_basics.py` | Main example with variables, lists, functions, JSON |
| `exercise1.py` | Your own script that takes inputs and saves data |
| `btc_data.json` | Output JSON file example |

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Variables** store information such as BTC price or wallet balance.  
- **Lists** hold multiple values (e.g., transactions).  
- **Dictionaries** hold key–value pairs (e.g., wallet info).  
- **Functions** make code reusable.  
- **JSON** is the format used by APIs and blockchain data.

---

## 🧪 Practice Task
1. Ask for BTC price and amount owned.  
2. Compute total portfolio in USD and EUR.  
3. Save it as a JSON file named `portfolio.json`.
